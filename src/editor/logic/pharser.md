Here's a focused review and recommendation for your AST and parser.rs design, specifically regarding the lifetime/ownership issue in your event stream parser:

## 3. **Best Practice in Rust AST/Event Stream Design**

### **A. Store `Block` Directly in Lists**
- **Why:** Traversal is safe and idiomatic; references are always valid.
- **How:** Lists store `Vec<Block>`.
- **Result:** You can safely push `&Block` references to your stack.

### **B. Use Shared Ownership (`Rc<Block>`)**
- **Why:** If you need to share blocks across the AST, use `Rc<Block>` for single-threaded or `Arc<Block>` for multi-threaded.
- **How:** Store `Rc<Block>` in your AST and stack.
- **Result:** You can clone and share blocks safely.

### **C. Arena Allocation**
- **Why:** For very large ASTs, use an arena allocator so all blocks live for the lifetime of the arena.
- **How:** Use crates like `typed-arena` or `bumpalo`.
- **Result:** You can take references to any block allocated in the arena.

## 4. **Recommended Action for Your Project**

### **Option 1: Refactor AST to Store `Block` in Lists**
- This is the simplest and most idiomatic solution for most Markdown parsers.
- You will be able to traverse and reference blocks safely.
- Minimal code changes, maximum safety.

### **Option 2: Use `Rc<Block>` for Shared Ownership**
- If you need to share blocks, refactor your AST to use `Rc<Block>`.
- Update your stack and event state to use `Rc<Block>`.

### **Option 3: Arena Allocation**
- If you expect very large documents and want maximum performance, use an arena.

## 5. **Concrete Next Steps**

1. **Refactor your AST:**
   - Change all list containers to store `Vec<Block>` instead of `Vec<ContainerBlock>`.
   - Update parser logic to traverse `Block` directly.

2. **Update your parser:**
   - Remove any code that creates temporary blocks for traversal.
   - Push references to blocks stored in the AST.

3. **Test:**
   - Run your event stream parser and ensure all references are valid and no lifetime errors occur.

## 6. **Summary Table**

| Approach         | Pros                        | Cons                        | When to Use                |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Store `Block`    | Simple, idiomatic, safe     | Slightly larger AST         | Most Markdown parsers      |
| Use `Rc<Block>`  | Shared ownership, flexible  | More heap allocations       | Complex, shared ASTs       |
| Arena Allocation | Fast, minimal allocations   | More complex setup          | Large, performance-critical|

Advanced Event Stream Features
1. Full Inline Traversal
Emit events for all inline types, not just text:
Code spans (Event::Code)
Emphasis/strong (Event::Start(Tag::Emphasis), Event::End(TagEnd::Emphasis))
Links/images (Event::Start(Tag::Link), Event::Text, Event::End(TagEnd::Link))
Autolinks, raw HTML, line breaks, etc.
2. Source Position Tracking
Include line/column info in events for error reporting, syntax highlighting, or mapping output to source.
3. Custom Attributes
Emit events with custom attributes (e.g., classes, IDs, data-* attributes) for advanced rendering or extensions.
- Propagate attributes for inline events (Emphasis, Strong, Link, etc.) for full coverage.
- Implement attribute parsing from Markdown syntax (e.g., `{.class #id}`) for advanced use cases.
- Add tests to verify attribute propagation for both blocks and inlines.
- Document attribute propagation and extension points for plugin authors.
4. Extension Support
Support for GFM features (tables, task lists, strikethrough, etc.) by emitting specialized events.
- Tables: Caption support (if needed) can be added.
- Math Blocks: Not present, but can be added as a new event.
- Emoji, Mentions, Task List Metadata: Not present, but can be added as needed. https://lib.rs/crates/gh-emoji
- Code Block Info Strings: If you want to support fenced code blocks with info strings, consider adding a CodeBlockStart event with language and attributes.
5. Event Filtering/Transformation
Allow users to filter, transform, or intercept events (e.g., for plugins, custom rendering, or analytics).

All above is done

6. Streaming Output
Design the iterator to work efficiently with very large documents, emitting events as soon as possible (no buffering).
7. Error/Warning Events
Emit events for parse errors, warnings, or unsupported features, so renderers can handle them gracefully.
8. Custom Tag Types
Add custom tags for user-defined extensions, block types, or inline types.
9. Event Grouping
Emit events for logical groups (e.g., a list of items, a table row) to simplify rendering.
10. Performance/Profiling Hooks
Emit timing or memory usage events for profiling and optimization.
