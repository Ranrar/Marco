Marco ‚Äî a lightweight Rust Markdown Composer, it is a GTK-based editor written in Rust. It's an experimental, extensible editor focused on structured editing, syntax-aware features, and custom markdown features.

## Features in Progress

The **UI is mostly complete**, and we‚Äôre now turning our focus to the engine behind Marco. We‚Äôre actively developing the **grammar, AST, and syntax rules** for the parser and renderer, which will bring the editor to life.

Right now, the editor is in an early stage ‚Äî features are limited ‚Äî but this will change as we implement the new Markdown capabilities.

Below is a **preview of what‚Äôs coming**:

- Structured **grammar and AST** for Markdown parsing
- Fully-featured **renderer** for inline and block elements
- Interactive **TOC, bookmarks, and page navigation**
- **Run code snippets** safely from the preview
- Enhanced **admonition blocks** and **mentions**
- Smooth **cross-document navigation** and page splitting

You can see a **live snippet** of the Markdown features we‚Äôre working on in the roadmap below. This is just the beginning ‚Äî soon, Marco will let you edit, preview, and navigate Markdown like never before.

## Text Formatting

* **Headings**: Use `#` at the start of a line to create titles and subtitles. These show up in the Table of Contents and help structure your document.
* **Bold**: Surround text with `**` to make it stand out.
* **Italic**: Surround text with `__` to add gentle emphasis.
* **Strikethrough**: Surround text with `--` to mark something as removed or outdated.
* **Highlight**: Surround text with `==` to draw attention without bolding.
* **Emoji**: Write `:smile:` and it will show üòä.

## Code, Math and Diagrams

* **Inline code**: use text between backticks `` ` `` to show short code snippets.
* **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks to create larger blocks of code. You can even add a language for syntax highlighting.
* **inline Math**: Put formulas between `$...$` for inline math.
* **Math block**: Use `$$...$$` for larger math expressions that display on their own line.
* **Diagrams**: Use special fenced blocks (like Mermaid or Graphviz) to render flowcharts, graphs, or diagrams directly in your document.

## Run code directly from Marco Preview

Marco lets you run code snippets **directly from your Markdown preview**, making your documentation interactive and hands-on.

* **Supported languages**: Bash, Zsh, Sh, Bat, PowerShell, and Python.

* **Safety first**: Marco always asks before running code. You can choose to run it in a **sandbox** (safe, isolated) or at the **system level**. Nothing runs automatically.

* **How it works**:

  * Use an **inline command** like:

    ```markdown
    @run(bash: echo "Hello World")
    ```
  * Or use a **fenced run block**:

    ````markdown
    ```run@python
    print("Hello from Python")
    ```
    ````

* **Immediate feedback**: The results are shown **right inside the preview**, so you see the output without leaving your document.
Perfect for **tutorials, documentation, and examples** where readers can try things out directly.

---

## Structure & Layout

* **Blockquotes**: Start a line with `>` to create a quote block.
* **Horizontal rule**: Use `---` for a visual divider.
* **Tables**: Create tables with headers, rows, and alignment. Great for structured data.
* **Task lists**: Write checkboxes with `- [ ]` or `- [x]` to track tasks.
* **Ordered lists**: Use `1.` `2.` `3.` for numbered steps.
* **Definition lists**: Use `term : explanation` for dictionary-style lists.

---

## Links, Media & Embeds

* **URLs**: Just paste a web link (http/https/www).
* **Email links**: Use `mailto:` to link to an email address.
* **Local files**: Link to files inside your project.
* **Images**: Insert images with a link to their file.
* **YouTube**: Paste a YouTube URL for an embedded video.
* **Inline links**: `[Text](url)` for a standard link.
* **Block images / YouTube**: Show media as its own block, with captions if needed.

## Table of Contents, Bookmarks & Page Navigation

Marco Markdown adds **powerful navigation features** to your Markdown documents, making them feel like interactive books or manuals.


### Table of Contents (TOC)

Automatically generate a **Table of Contents** from your headings.

* Shows headings in a hierarchy (H1‚ÄìH6)
* Can only be **local** (current page) and can span multiple linked pages
* Optional depth: limit how many heading levels appear
* Collapsible sections supported

**Example usage:**

```markdown
[toc]          # Local TOC
[toc=2]        # Limit depth to H1-H2
[toc=2](@Page) # Include linked pages in the TOC
```

TOC entries are linked to headings in your document, providing **clickable navigation** in previews or exports.

### Bookmarks

Bookmarks link to a **specific file and line number**, making it easy to jump between sections or highlight important points.

```markdown
[Bookmark: Project Overview](./project_overview.md=254)
```

* Links are **local to your project**
* Line numbers are optional; Marco fills them automatically if missing
* Preview shows a **colored snippet or icon**, like a real bookmark

Use bookmarks for **quick navigation or highlighting sections** across files.

### Page Tags & References

#### In-Document Page Splits

Page tags control **page layout and splitting**, useful for export to PDF or structured previews.

```markdown
[Page=A4]   # Start a page in A4 layout
[Page=US]   # Start a page in US Letter layout
[Page=]     # Auto-numbered page
[Page=65]   # Explicit page number
```

* Red vertical lines in the editor show splits
* Marco automatically tracks page numbers
* Works together with TOC and bookmarks

#### Cross-Document Navigation

Link forward or backward across Markdown files using `[@Page]`:

```markdown
[@Page](./chapter_03.md)   # Next document
[@Page](./chapter_02.md)   # Previous document
```

* Place at the **bottom of the current file** (next page) or **top of target file** (previous page)
* Marco generates arrows in previews:

```
‚Üê Previous Page 62 | 63 | Next Page 64 ‚Üí
```

* Only **local Markdown files** are supported
* Works seamlessly with TOC and bookmarks for a unified reading experience

### Unified Navigation Flow

Combine **page splits** (`[Page=]`) with **cross-document references** (`[@Page]`) to create a smooth, book-like flow:

| File            | Action / Marker            | Description                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `chapter_02.md` | `[Page=]`                  | Start a new page (in-document split) |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | Last page of chapter                 |
|                 | `[@Page](./chapter_03.md)` | Next chapter link                    |
| `chapter_03.md` | `[@Page](./chapter_02.md)` | Previous chapter link                |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | First in-document split              |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | Last in-document split               |
|                 | `[@Page](./chapter_04.md)` | Next chapter link                    |


* **Arrows** guide readers between pages and chapters
* Works with TOC for multi-page or multi-file documents
* Keeps your Markdown structured, navigable, and export-ready

## Admonition Blocks

Admonitions create **highlighted blocks** for notes, tips, warnings, info, or custom icons ‚Äî helping important information stand out.

### Predefined Types

Use one of the built-in types: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`.

```markdown
:::note
Some **content** with Markdown `syntax`.
:::
```

With an optional title:

```markdown
:::note[Optional Title]
Some **content** with Markdown formatting.
:::
```

* Content supports full Markdown
* Title is plain Markdown (no emoji/icons allowed)
* The block ends with `:::`


### Custom Emoji / Icon

Use a custom emoji to visually represent the block type:

```markdown
:::[:smile:] Some **content** with Markdown `syntax`. :::
```

With an optional title:

```markdown
:::[:smile: Your Title]
Some **content** with Markdown formatting.
:::
```

* Emoji goes inside `[ ]` and acts as the block type
* Optional title comes after the emoji (Markdown allowed)
* Content continues until the closing `:::`

---

## Callouts / Mentions

Mentions let you **tag people and link to their public profiles**. The format is:

```
@username[platform](Optional Display Name)
```

* **@username** ‚Üí The account name (**required**)
* **\[platform]** ‚Üí The platform (**required**)
* **(Optional Display Name)** ‚Üí A custom name to show instead of the username

---

### Examples

| Mention Syntax                        | Displayed As           | Link / Profile |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `@ranrar[github]`                     | @ranrar              | https://github.com/ranrar |
| `@ranrar[github](Kim Skov Rasmussen)` | Kim Skov Rasmussen   | https://github.com/ranrar |
| `@someone[twitter](Jane Doe)`         | Jane Doe             | https://twitter.com/someone |
| `@teammate[slack](Project Lead)`      | Project Lead         | Slack profile link |

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes. Short workflow:

1. Open an issue describing the change or bug you plan to address.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Add tests where appropriate and keep changes small and focused.
4. Run `cargo build` and `cargo test` locally.
5. Open a pull request referencing the issue and describe the change.

Code style & expectations:

- Keep UI code in `src/ui/` and business logic in `logic/`.
- Follow Rust idioms (use `Result<T, E>`, avoid panics in library code).
- Add unit tests and integration tests in `tests/` when applicable.

### High-value contributions

If you'd like to make a high-impact contribution, consider one of these areas ‚Äî open an issue first so we can coordinate:

- Collaborative editing (Yjs / CRDT): add a `components/collab/` backend that implements a `CollabBackend` trait and provide in-process tests for concurrent patches and cursor sync.
- AI-assisted tools: add a `components/ai/` interface for suggestions/edits; keep adapters off the UI thread and provide a small example implementation.

### Component docs & assets

Reference locations for contributors working on components and translations:

- [src/components/ai/README.md](src/components/ai/README.md) ‚Äî AI component guidance and interface notes
- [src/components/collab/README.md](src/components/collab/README.md) ‚Äî Collaboration integration notes and references
- [src/components/language/README.md](src/components/language/README.md) ‚Äî Localization provider contract and workflow
- [src/assets/language/language matrix.md](src/assets/language/language%20matrix.md) ‚Äî language implementation matrix

If you add new component folders, please include a short `README.md` in the folder that explains the contract, tests, and how to run the component's dev harness.
