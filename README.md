Marco ‚Äî a lightweight Rust Markdown Composer, it is a GTK-based editor written in Rust. It's an experimental, extensible editor focused on structured editing, syntax-aware features, and custom markdown features.

## Project Structure

Marco is organized as a Cargo workspace with three crates:

- **`marco_core`** - Core markdown parsing library (no UI dependencies)
  - Custom pest-based grammar and parser
  - AST builder and HTML renderer
  - Business logic and settings management
  - Can be used as a standalone library

- **`marco`** - Full-featured markdown editor (main application)
  - GTK4-based UI with SourceView5 editor
  - WebKit6 preview rendering
  - Complete editing and preview experience

- **`polo`** - Viewer-only mode (coming soon)
  - Lightweight markdown viewer
  - Simplified UI for reading rendered markdown
  - No editor dependencies

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build --workspace

# Build specific crates
cargo build -p marco_core   # Core library only
cargo build -p marco        # Full editor
cargo build -p polo         # Viewer only

# Run Marco
cargo run -p marco
```

## Features in Progress

Marco is currently in active development with a focus on perfecting our custom markdown grammar and parser. We're approximately **90% complete** with the core implementation, working on polishing the codebase and ensuring robust parsing of all markdown constructs.

**Current development focus:**
- Fine-tuning the **pest-based grammar** for comprehensive markdown support
- Polishing the **AST builder** and **HTML renderer** components
- Implementing robust **error handling** and **edge case coverage**
- Optimizing **parser performance** and **memory usage**

Below is a **preview of whats coming**:

- Structured **grammar and AST** for Markdown parsing
- Fully-featured **renderer** for inline and block elements
- Interactive **TOC, bookmarks, and page navigation**
- **Run code snippets** safely from the preview
- Enhanced **admonition blocks** and **mentions**
- Smooth **cross-document navigation** and page splitting

You can see a **live snippet** of the Markdown features were working on in the roadmap below. This is just the beginning ‚Äî soon, Marco will let you edit, preview, and navigate Markdown like never before.

## Text Formatting

* **Headings**: Use `#` at the start of a line to create titles and subtitles. These show up in the Table of Contents and help structure your document.
* **Bold**: Surround text with `**` to make it stand out.
* **Italic**: Surround text with `__` to add gentle emphasis.
* **Strikethrough**: Surround text with `--` to mark something as removed or outdated.
* **Highlight**: Surround text with `==` to draw attention without bolding.
* **Emoji**: Write `:smile:` and it will show üòä.

## Code, Math and Diagrams

* **Inline code**: use text between backticks `` ` `` to show short code snippets.
* **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks to create larger blocks of code. You can even add a language for syntax highlighting.
* **inline Math**: Put formulas between `$...$` for inline math.
* **Math block**: Use `$$...$$` for larger math expressions that display on their own line.
* **Diagrams**: Use special fenced blocks (like Mermaid or Graphviz) to render flowcharts, graphs, or diagrams directly in your document.

---

## Run code directly from Marco Preview

Marco lets you run code snippets **directly from your Markdown preview**, making your documentation interactive and hands-on.

* **Supported languages**: Bash, Zsh, Sh, Bat, PowerShell, and Python.

* **Safety first**: Marco always asks before running code. You can choose to run it in a **sandbox** (safe, isolated) or at the **system level**. Nothing runs automatically.

* **How it works**:

  * Use an **inline command** like:

    ```markdown
    @run(bash: echo "Hello World")
    ```
  * Or use a **fenced run block**:

    ````markdown
    ```run@python
    print("Hello from Python")
    ```
    ````

* **Immediate feedback**: The results are shown **right inside the preview**, so you see the output without leaving your document.
Perfect for **tutorials, documentation, and examples** where readers can try things out directly.

---

## Structure & Layout

* **Blockquotes**: Start a line with `>` to create a quote block.
* **Horizontal rule**: Use `---` for a visual divider.
* **Tables**: Create tables with headers, rows, and alignment. Great for structured data.
* **Task lists**: Write checkboxes with `- [ ]` or `- [x]` to track tasks.
* **Ordered lists**: Use `1.` `2.` `3.` for numbered steps.
* **Definition lists**: Use `term : explanation` for dictionary-style lists.

---

## Links, Media & Embeds

* **URLs**: Just paste a web link (http/https/www).
* **Email links**: Use `mailto:` to link to an email address.
* **Local files**: Link to files inside your project.
* **Images**: Insert images with a link to their file.
* **YouTube**: Paste a YouTube URL for an embedded video.
* **Inline links**: `[Text](url)` for a standard link.
* **Block images / YouTube**: Show media as its own block, with captions if needed.

---

## Table of Contents, Bookmarks & Page Navigation

Marco Markdown adds **powerful navigation features** to your Markdown documents, making them feel like interactive books or manuals.


### Table of Contents (TOC)

Automatically generate a **Table of Contents** from your headings.

* Shows headings in a hierarchy (H1-H6)
* Can only be **local** (current page) and can span multiple linked pages
* Optional depth: limit how many heading levels appear
* Collapsible sections supported

**Example usage:**

```markdown
[toc]          # Local TOC
[toc=2]        # Limit depth to H1-H2
[toc=2](@Page) # Include linked pages in the TOC
```

TOC entries are linked to headings in your document, providing **clickable navigation** in previews or exports.

### Bookmarks

Bookmarks link to a **specific file and line number**, making it easy to jump between sections or highlight important points.

```markdown
[Bookmark: Project Overview](./project_overview.md=254)
```

* Links are **local to your project**
* Line numbers are optional; Marco fills them automatically if missing
* Preview shows a **colored snippet or icon**, like a real bookmark

Use bookmarks for **quick navigation or highlighting sections** across files.

### Page Tags & References

#### In-Document Page Splits

Page tags control **page layout and splitting**, useful for export to PDF or structured previews.

```markdown
[Page=A4]   # Start a page in A4 layout
[Page=US]   # Start a page in US Letter layout
[Page=]     # Auto-numbered page
[Page=65]   # Explicit line number
```

* Red vertical lines in the editor show splits
* Marco automatically tracks page numbers
* Works together with TOC and bookmarks

#### Cross-Document Navigation

Link forward or backward across Markdown files using `[@doc]`:

```markdown
[@doc](./chapter_03.md)   # Next document
[@doc](./chapter_02.md)   # Previous document
```

* Place at the **bottom of the current file** (next page) or **top of target file** (previous page)
* Marco generates arrows in previews:

```
‚Üê Previous Page 62 | 63/100 | Next Page 64 ‚Üí
```

* Only **local Markdown files** are supported
* Works seamlessly with TOC and bookmarks for a unified reading experience

### Unified Navigation Flow

Combine **page splits** (`[Page=]`) with **cross-document references** (`[@Page]`) to create a smooth, book-like flow:

| File            | Action / Marker            | Description                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `chapter_02.md` | `[Page=]`                  | Start a new page (in-document split) |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | Last page of chapter                 |
|                 | `[@Page](./chapter_03.md)` | Next chapter link                    |
| `chapter_03.md` | `[@Page](./chapter_02.md)` | Previous chapter link                |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | First in-document split              |
|                 | `[Page=]`                  | Last in-document split               |
|                 | `[@Page](./chapter_04.md)` | Next chapter link                    |


* **Arrows** guide readers between pages and chapters
* Works with TOC for multi-page or multi-file documents
* Keeps your Markdown structured, navigable, and export-ready

## Admonition Blocks

Admonitions create **highlighted blocks** for notes, tips, warnings, info, or custom icons ‚Äî helping important information stand out.

### Predefined Types

Use one of the built-in types: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`.

```markdown
:::note
Some **content** with Markdown `syntax`.
:::
```

With an optional title:

```markdown
:::note[Optional Title]
Some **content** with Markdown formatting.
:::
```

* Content supports full Markdown
* Title is plain Markdown (no emoji/icons allowed)
* The block ends with `:::`


### Custom Emoji / Icon

Use a custom emoji to visually represent the block type:

```markdown
:::[:smile:] Some **content** with Markdown `syntax`. :::
```

With an optional title:

```markdown
:::[:smile: Your Title]
Some **content** with Markdown formatting.
:::
```

* Emoji goes inside `[ ]` and acts as the block type
* Optional title comes after the emoji (Markdown allowed)
* Content continues until the closing `:::`

---

## Callouts / Mentions

Mentions let you **tag people and link to their public profiles**. The format is:

```
@username[platform](Optional Display Name)
```

* **@username** ‚Üí The account name (**required**)
* **\[platform]** ‚Üí The platform (**required**)
* **(Optional Display Name)** ‚Üí A custom name to show instead of the username

---

### Examples

| Mention Syntax                        | Displayed As           | Link / Profile |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `@ranrar[github]`                     | @ranrar              | https://github.com/ranrar |
| `@ranrar[github](Kim Skov Rasmussen)` | Kim Skov Rasmussen   | https://github.com/ranrar |
| `@someone[twitter](Jane Doe)`         | Jane Doe             | https://twitter.com/someone |
| `@teammate[slack](Project Lead)`      | Project Lead         | Slack profile link |

## Architecture & internals

- **GTK4-RS** (`gtk4`, `glib`, `gio`) - Cross-platform GUI framework providing the main application window, widgets, and event handling. Used for the editor interface, menus, toolbars, and all user interactions.

- **SourceView5** (`sourceview5`) - Advanced text editor component with syntax highlighting and code editing features. Provides the main markdown editing area with features like line numbers, search/replace, and text formatting.

- **WebKit6** (`webkit6`) - Modern web engine for HTML rendering and preview. Displays the live markdown preview with support for local images, custom CSS themes, and JavaScript interactions like scroll synchronization.

- **Pest** (`pest`, `pest_derive`) - Parser generator for creating the custom markdown grammar. Used in the marco_engine component to parse markdown into an AST, enabling fine-grained control over rendering and future extensibility for custom markdown features.

- **RON** (`ron`) - Rusty Object Notation for configuration files. Used for settings storage, theme definitions, and user preferences with a human-readable format that's easy to edit and version control.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes. Short workflow:

1. Open an issue describing the change or bug you plan to address.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Add tests where appropriate and keep changes small and focused.
4. Run `cargo build` and `cargo test` locally.
5. Open a pull request referencing the issue and describe the change.

Code style & expectations:

- Keep UI code in `src/ui/` and business logic in `logic/`.
- Follow Rust idioms (use `Result<T, E>`, avoid panics in library code).
- Add unit tests and integration tests in `tests/` when applicable.

### High-value contributions

If you'd like to make a high-impact contribution, consider one of these areas ‚Äî open an issue first so we can coordinate:

- Collaborative editing (Yjs / CRDT): add a `components/collab/` backend that implements a `CollabBackend` trait and provide in-process tests for concurrent patches and cursor sync.
- AI-assisted tools: add a `components/ai/` interface for suggestions/edits; keep adapters off the UI thread and provide a small example implementation.

### Component docs & assets

Reference locations for contributors working on components and translations:

- [src/components/ai/README.md](src/components/ai/README.md) ‚Äî AI component guidance and interface notes
- [src/components/collab/README.md](src/components/collab/README.md) ‚Äî Collaboration integration notes and references
